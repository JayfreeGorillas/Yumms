Take home Project for Fetch Rewards.

The entire application is built programmatically using UIKit and the MVC architecture. 

Users are able to View Desserts that come from the https://themealdb.com/  API.
Users will be able to choose a dessert and view a Detailed page with the instructions and ingredients required to make the dessert. 

***************************
Challenges while building

Deciding on the final Architecture and Design of the Detail page
Removing nil or empty values that would be returned from the API
Created custom cells
Created dynamic row height cells to handle different text sizes for certain dessert instructions
***************************

Places to improve upon

The database provides a lot of deatails about a chosen dessert such as video instructions on how to prepare the meal. adding an AV player to play the videos from youtube would be a nice touch.
At the moment the app does not work without a network connection. could use core data to hold onto values from the last time user was connected to the internet to enable offline use
Could add a favorites feature so users can have a personalized list of favorited desserts to go back to easily
